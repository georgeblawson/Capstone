# Capstone
## Objective
For my Capstone project in the Digital Futures Academy I worked on creating a function that could taking in some dialogue as a string and return wether Sheldon, from the tv show the Big Bang Theory, said it or not. I chose this project to allow me to practice Natural Language Processing. In order to do this I was hypothesising that the langueage used by Sheldon differs from the language used by other characters on the show.
## Data
The data was scraped by Mitra Mirshafiee from the https://bigbangtrans.wordpress.com/ and then uploaded to Kaggle. It contains the full transcript from the show along with information about the episode and series that the dialogue is from, along with which character has said it.
